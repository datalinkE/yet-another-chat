# What and why?
Backend for messaging app with **a lot of  of code generation** (protobuf schemes + twirp framework).  
Not for any production use, just playing with the idea.
See Dockerfile if you are interested in tooling.  
Or just do
```
	make run
```
to run service in docker and expose port 9000 on docker ip.
